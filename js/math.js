//STEP 1 - Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Regardless of whether they enter a negative or 
//         positive number, make sure to display the positive version of that number in the console window. 
//         If I enter -15 in the prompt and -15 is displayed in the console window, you did this one wrong.

//STEP 2 - Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that 
//         input in a variable and then round it up to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console 
//         window.

//STEP 3 - Create an application that prompts the user for a floating point value (decimal). Store the result of that 
//         input in a variable and then round it down to the nearest whole number. Display the result within a console 
//         window.

//STEP 4 - Create an application that prompts the user for 5 numbers. Ask them to comma delimit each number so you 
//         get 1,2,3,4,5 for example. Store the result of that input in a variable and then find the largest and 
//         smallest numbers in that list. Display both of those numbers within a console window.

//STEP 5 - Create an application that prompts the user for a number. Now find the square root of that number and 
//         display the result within a console window.
